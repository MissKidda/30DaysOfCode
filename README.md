# MiscallenousCodeToBeginnerProblems
I completed a 3-month Java programming bootcamp in March 2019.
This is a collection of some of the code for solutions to problems given in class.
Excuse the disorganization, all I've done so far is paste the files on here. I will then organize them and add a description of the problems that each code solves.
