I completed a 3-month Java programming bootcamp in March 2019.
I still have a lot to learn about programming, especially algorithms and solving problems. I have decided to do Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code Challenge. Here I will post my solutions for each challenge as I solve them, along with comments about my approach or the problem in general.
